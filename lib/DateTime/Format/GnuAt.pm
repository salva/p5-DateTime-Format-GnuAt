=head1 NAME

DateTime::Format::GnuAt - Parse time specifications as Debian 'at' command.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use DateTime::Format::GnuAt;

  $parser = DateTime::Format::GnuAt->new;
  $dt = $parser->parse_datetime("today");
  $dt = $parser->parse_datetime("next week + 3 days");


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements the same parser rules as Debian 'at' command
(which is also the 'at' used by most non Debian based Linux
distributions).

From the C<at> manual page:

=over

C<at> allows fairly complex time specifications, extending the POSIX.2
standard.  It accepts times of the form C<HH:MM> to run a job at a
specific time of day. (If that time is already past, the next day is
assumed.) You may also specify C<minight>, C<noon>, or C<teatime>
(4pm) and you can have a time-of-day suffixed with C<AM> or C<PM> for
running in the morning or the evening.  You can also say what day the
job will be run, by giving a date in the form C<month-name day> with
an optional C<year>, or giving a date of the form C<MMDD[CC]YY>,
C<MM/DD/[CC]YY>, C<DD.MM.[CC]YY> or C<[CC]YY-MM-DD>. The specification
of a date must follow the specification of the time of day. You can
also give times like C<now + count time-units>, where the time-units
can be C<minutes>, C<hours>, C<days>, or C<weeks> and you can tell at
to run the job today by suffixing the time with C<today> and to run
the job tomorrow by suffixing the time with C<tomorrow>.

For example, to run a job at 4pm three days from now, you would do
C<at 4pm + 3 days>, to run a job at 10:00am on July 31, you would do
C<at 10am Jul 31> and to run a job at 1am tomorrow, you would do C<at
1am tomorrow>.

The definition of the time specification can be found in
C</usr/share/doc/at/timespec>.

=back

=head2 API

The module provides the following methods:

=over 4

=item my $p = DateTime::Format::GnuAt->new;

Returns a new date-time parser object.

=item my $datetime = $p->parse_datetime($string)

=item my $datetime = $p->parse_datetime($string, %opts)

Parses the given string and returns a DateTime object. On failure it
croaks.

The following options can also be passed to the method as a list of
C<$key => $value> pairs after the date-time specification:

=over 4

=item now => $datetime

A DateTime object to be used as the current "now".

This allows to parse the date-time specifications relative to a custom
date.

It can also be used to set the default time-zone (by default C<local>
is used).
